  Meowser

> [!CAUTION]
> Meowser was originally created with Electron, however this had major limitations and was basically reinventing the wheel when the wheel already exists. We're currently working on porting Meowser to the Gecko engine. You can still use the Electron version of Meowser to try it out but please note the Electron version (1.0) will not be updated anymore, even for security updates. Please wait for us to re-release the Gecko version of Meowser. Thank you! 

A work-in-progress privacy-focused browser made with Electron.
